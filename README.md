## Prototype

You can find a something like a working prototype here => https://mersenne1729.github.io/know-your-area-api


## Technical

The app is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, and makes use of three JSON calls to the *YouTube*, *Wikipedia* and *Google Maps* Open Platform APIs to return the data. All data is held in memory during the user's session.
